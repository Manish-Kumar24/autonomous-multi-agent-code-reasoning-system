1️⃣ Current Status

✅ Frontend: React + Tailwind (UI done, inputs, buttons, output panel, gradient styling, loader)
✅ Backend: FastAPI (clone repo functionality working, repo gets cloned locally)

2️⃣ Remaining Core Features

Repo Analysis / Code Reasoning

After the repo is cloned, we need to:

Scan the repo files

Parse code files (Python, JS, TS, etc.)

Possibly create embeddings or run code understanding models (DeepSeek / GPT)

Outcome: a structured representation of the repo (functions, classes, modules, README, etc.)

DeepSeek Integration

Embed the UI interaction with DeepSeek Coder (if needed)

For now, we said UI only, so backend logic will handle repo parsing + reasoning

Code Query / AI Analysis

Allow user to ask questions like:

“What does this repo do?”

“List all functions in main.py”

“Explain this module”

The backend processes the query and responds

Output Rendering

Display AI’s answers in the output panel

Possibly allow rich formatting (code blocks, syntax highlighting)

Optional Features / Enhancements

Multi-file navigation: show tree view of repo

Syntax-highlighted code viewer

Export results: save AI analysis as markdown or PDF

Authentication (if you want users to save their session)

3️⃣ Flow of Execution

Here’s a clear step-by-step execution flow of your app:

User enters inputs on UI

Repo URL

Folder Name

Clicks Clone Repo

Frontend sends POST request

Endpoint: /clone-repo

Payload: { repo_url, folder_name }

Backend clones the repo

Uses GitPython

Stores repo locally under backend/repos/<folder_name>

Returns message: "Repo cloned at <path>"

Backend parses the repo

Identify files, languages, functions, classes, dependencies

Optionally generate embeddings or feed into AI model

Frontend updates the output panel

Shows either cloning success/failure initially

Later shows AI reasoning or code insights

Optional: Advanced querying

User types question

Frontend sends request to backend (/analyze-repo)

Backend runs AI model or analysis function

Returns structured answer

Frontend renders in Output panel

4️⃣ Next Steps

Given where you are, here’s what we should focus on next:

Implement repo parsing and basic code analysis

List files and folders

Identify code types (Python, JS, etc.)

Extract functions, classes, docstrings

Connect AI reasoning / DeepSeek / GPT to answer queries about the repo

Enhance UI output panel to show:

Code snippets

AI-generated explanations

Optional: add multi-repo support, history, or tree-view
